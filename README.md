# Microsoft Hackathon 2024: Storytellers Guild

This project contains a Microsoft word plug-in that adds a customized ChatGPT bot that can answer questions about your Word document. The AI model is tuned to answer DnD/Lore-related questions

Here you will see two folders:
- dndOneNote: an incomplete OneNote plugin (abandoned)
- Chronicle Keeper: the more complete Word plugin (current)

# TODO items
- Improve the AI prompts so the model gives us better solutions
- Improve the design of the send button
- Test the model with longer word documents/more complicated questions
- Whatever feature you find interesting!
